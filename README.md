# Sound-Reacting-LED-Strips
A circuit that changes the color of an LED light strip based on the amplitude of the sound in the room. The logic behind this is the conversion between analog and digital values as well as the digital output that governs the turning on and off of the LEDs on the light strip. Lastly, the IR sensor also decides the performance by sending a digital signal to tell whether the entire system will be activated. The purpose of this project is to use a sound sensor to light up LEDs by playing a song or making noise by utilizing a sound sensor. With a light and portable 3D-printed LED pole, anyone can ditch the strip lights in the ceiling and make a cool sound-reacting lamp to liven up their dorm room.
